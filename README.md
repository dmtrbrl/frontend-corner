[Frontend Corner](https://www.frontendcorner.com) is an experimental, AI-curated weekly digest for frontend developers who want to stay current with the latest in UI, web development, and related technologies – without spending hours chasing down quality content.

Each week, it scans a curated list of RSS feeds, collecting fresh articles and updates from trusted sources across the frontend landscape. The AI then steps in to review, summarize, and organize the content into a fully described, issue-style digest. It doesn’t just list links – it provides context, commentary, and a snapshot of what’s actually worth your attention.

Although this is a solo project, it’s also open for contributions. [The list of sources](https://github.com/dmtrbrl/frontend-corner/blob/main/data/sources.json) is managed on GitHub, and anyone is welcome to suggest new RSS feeds or update existing ones.

Frontend Corner is more than just a curated feed – it’s an ongoing experiment in using AI to not only gather information but also curate, interpret, and present it in a useful, developer-friendly way. If that sounds like your kind of thing, you’re in the right corner of the web.
