  "challenge": "Challenge of the week: Create a dynamic bookshelf using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Utilize CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout, and enhance it with 3D animations using WebGL or Canvas for book covers. Add interactivity by allowing users to 'flip' through books, revealing additional content or animations. Aim for accessibility, ensuring the bookshelf is navigable via keyboard and screen readers. This exercise encourages exploring creative design and interactivity without relying on frameworks, though integration with Three.js for extra flair is welcome."
